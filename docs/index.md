## what we do

We want to help decision makers understand the information and communications technology they are buying and using in their organisations. This feels like useful work given the ever-increasing importance of technology for delivering public services.

## how we work

We will set up projects that build datasets and analytical tools for particular areas of technology use in public services. We hope these will be useful resources that feed into discussions about service improvements.

## who we are
This service has been set up by Richard Allan who has worked in technology and policy for over 25 years.

## projects

We worked on a pilot project looking at technology in the UK health and care sector in the latter part of 2024 and have published this at [nhstech.uk/paperless](https://nhstech.uk/paperless.html).
