### Welcome to the RTFM Club.

(No, not that one. Ours stands for **Regulate Tech For Managers**.)

We’re here to help public services buy and use technology that *actually* works.

### 🤔 What's the big idea?

You know the story. We all carry supercomputers in our pockets, making it easy to share cat videos or order a taxi in seconds. That tech is fast, cheap, and simple.

So why, when a nurse tries to check a patient record, are they fighting with a system that feels like a clunky, overpriced Nokia from twenty years ago?

It's absurd. Public services end up with slow, baffling tech that staff hate using, and taxpayers pay a fortune for it.

The RTFM Club is here to fix this. We dig into the details (we’re the ones who *actually* read the manual!) so that managers can make better, smarter choices.

**Our goal: Make public tech simple, useful, and at least as good as the app you use for your weekly shop.**

### 🛠️ How we do it

We’re data detectives. We run projects that uncover what’s really happening with tech in a specific area (like the health service or local government).

We don't write 200-page, dust-gathering reports. We build straightforward guides, maps, and tools that show what works, what doesn't, and why. No jargon, just clear answers to simple questions.

### 🧔 Who's behind this?

The club was set up by **Richard Allan**.

After more than 25 years of trying to connect the worlds of tech and politics—working in Parliament, at big tech companies, and now as a regulator (he's on the Board of Ofcom)—he decided it was time to build a "friendly manual" for public service tech.

### 🚀 Our First Case: The NHS

We started by diving into the tech used in health and care, asking what a lack of progress on "going paperless" *really* costs.
