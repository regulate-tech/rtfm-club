title: Electronic Health Records Tutorial
slug: rtfm-ehr
---

The NHS spends many millions on Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems and the UK Government has ambitious plans to digitise health records across the country. 

RTFM Club has created a tutorial to help decision makers understand how EHR systems work.

We have shared a first version on [GitHub](https://github.com/regulate-tech/rtfm-ehr) and would welcome feedback and contributions.

We are now working on options to run it on a hosted platform so that people can try it out without needing to set up a local environment.

If you are interested in helping with this, please file an issue in the repository.
